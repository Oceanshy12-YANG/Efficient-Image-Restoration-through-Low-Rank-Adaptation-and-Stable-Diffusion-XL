In the image shown, we have added blur and SR to the real-world image. It can be seen that the image restored by the model has high quality, but this is thanks to SUPIR. What we have done is to surpass SUPIR in texture and detail, and will have a faster generation speed


## Data set
Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset, CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. We use 1300 of them as the dataset for face training.
